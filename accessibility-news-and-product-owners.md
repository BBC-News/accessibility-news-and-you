Accessibility should be considered from the start of the product life cycle and throughout.

To gain an understanding of accessibility features and what to look for it is recommended to attend the Accessible UX course and complete the [Accessibility for Web Developers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/beta/course/COU-12887) <small>(Internal BBC link)</small> online course. The [Introduction to Screen Readers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/beta/course/COU-50344015) <small>(Internal BBC link)</small> course would also be very useful.

0. Are you aware of the [BBC Accessibility Standards and Guidelines](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/mobile/)?

0. Do you have an understanding of what [Assistive Technology we support](accessibility-and-supported-assistive-technology), such as screen readers? And how to use this?
