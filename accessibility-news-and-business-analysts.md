To gain an understanding of accessibility features and what to look for it is recommended to attend the Accessible UX course and complete the [Accessibility for Web Developers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/beta/course/COU-12887) <small>(Internal BBC link)</small> online course. The [Introduction to Screen Readers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/beta/course/COU-50344015) <small>(Internal BBC link)</small> course would also be very useful.

## Checklist - Before development starts

## Checklist - When live

0. You can use the bbc-a11y Pa11y Dashboard to check for code errors against the BBC Accessibility Standards. Note passing the standards does not mean a product is useable. This dashboard is to be released early 2017.
