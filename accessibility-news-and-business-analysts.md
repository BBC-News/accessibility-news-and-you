To gain an understanding of accessibility features and what to look for it is recommended to attend the Accessible UX course and complete the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/beta/course/COU-12887">Accessibility for Web Developers</a> online course. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/beta/course/COU-50344015">Introduction to Screen Readers</a> course would also be very useful.

</ol>
