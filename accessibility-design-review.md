title: Accessibility design review
---
All the digital products we produce must meet the **[BBC Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/)**. 

Accessibility design reviews will help embed accessibility in components from the start:

- Carry out a review on **all design work before sign-off**
- For new components as well as iterations
- Allow enough time to address any issues after the review

Read **[getting started](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/how-to-design-for-accessibility#getting-started)** for somethings to consider before the review takes place.

## Organise a review
- Ask an **Accessibility Champion** (from any discipline) to review the component with you
- Allow 1 to 2 hours for the review, depending on the complexity of the component
- Review at component level rather than page level

Working on a large project? If so, organise regular reviews throughout the design phase. You can then take feedback onboard in stages.

## Review checklist
Work through the checklist together. Use each item as a conversation point and make a note of any issues or concerns that arise.

0. **[Screen reader UX](#1-screen-reader-ux)**
1. **[Initial look and see](#2-initial-look-and-see)**
2. **[Most users, most the time](#3-most-users-most-the-time)**
3. **[Best practice](#4-best-practice)**
4. **[User research](#5-user-research)**

### 1) Screen reader UX
Defining the screen reader UX is part of the design process. This communicates the user experience for screen reader users to the development team.

- Without showing the reviewer a visual. Use the screen reader UX to describe the component.
- Does the user experience make sense without seeing the visual?
- If you are having to explain a part of the user experience, that could be an area to explore making clearer.

Don’t worry **if you haven’t** documented the screen reader user experience yet. You can define this as part of the review process, after the rest of the items in the checklist are complete.

### 2) Initial look and see
Have an initial look at the visual user experience. Does anything stand out as an accessibility concern?

- Take it in turn to try and spot an issue
- If you are having to explain a part of the user experience, that could be an area to explore making clearer

### 3) Most users, most the time
Work through the **[key considerations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/how-to-design-for-accessibility#key-considerations)** for users, this will cover 80% of people, 80% of the time. 

### 4) Best practice
Use the following best practice accessibility guides as a conversation point:

- **[Dos and don’ts of designing for accessibility](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/dos-donts/posters_en-UK/accessibility-posters-set.pdf)** posters by Home Office Digital
- **[Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/posters/single.pdf)** posters by Barclays (a more **[detailed version of the inclusive design principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/posters/multiple.pdf)** is also available).

### 5) User research
Has any **[user research](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/how-to-design-for-accessibility#user-testing)** taken place, or is any user research planned? If so, have you included participants with accessibility needs? 

Not sure who to include and when, see the **[researching access needs: who to include when](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/researching-access-needs/Research-who_to_include_when%3F.pdf)** poster by Home Office Digital.
