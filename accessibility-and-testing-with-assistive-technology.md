title: Accessibility and Testing with Assistive Technology
---

Usage instructions and testing steps for supported assistive technology. Test on an actual device if possible. Is the feature useable, does it make sense?

Testing with assistive technology is just one part of the [Testers checklist](https://bbc-news.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-news-and-testers).

Not sure which assistive technology you should be testing with? See [Accessibility and Supported Assistive Technology](accessibility-and-supported-assistive-technology).
